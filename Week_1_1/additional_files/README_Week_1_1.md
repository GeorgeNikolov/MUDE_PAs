# Week 1.1 Instructions: Getting Started in MUDE!

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/)*

Welcome to the first week of MUDE! It looks like you have successfully found the instructions: this file gives an overview of what you are expected to do this week, and how. As you get used to the way MUDE is set up, this weekly README may no longer be needed.

This week, the primary activies are:  

- **Introductory Lecture** on Tuesday (next week we start the "normal" Monday morning lectures at 8:45---don't forget your coffee)  
- **Reading**: introductory modelling chapters in the online textbook (see the [Calendar](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/draft/calendar/) on the Course Website)  
  + **Wednesday Workshop** (10:45-12:30):  
  + **Software Installation**: you should prepare your computer and software before class starts on Wednesday; you will be able to use class time to resolve any issues or questions you may have from the software installation, but keep in mind this may cut into time working with your group. See the [Getting Started page](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/getting_started/) on the course website for instructions.  
- **Programming Assignment 1** (PA01): started in class on Wednesday (after week 1, programming assignments will typically be completed outside of class).  
- **Project 1** (P1): in class on Friday.  
- In addition, you should take some time to read the course website and get familiar with the Answers platform.  

During weeks 1 and 2 you are expected to access files through GitLab. If you have never done so, you will first need to log in to the platform at [https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/users/sign_in](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/users/sign_in) using your NetID. This is the only way to access the required files for the Wednesday in-class session, the first programming assignment (PA01) and project (P1).

Once you have logged in to GitLab using your NetID:
 
- go to [gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/2023-week-1](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/2023-project-1) and download the files as a `*.zip` folder. There are also instructions on the web page.  
- unzip the files and transfer them to your **working directory** (note the [Getting Started page](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/getting_started/))  
- open the notebook in Jupyter Lab and get started on the programming assignment! (make sure you follow the instructions for creating an environment on the [Getting Started page](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/getting_started/)).  

For the project on Friday, you will follow the same procedure but start with a different GitLab repository: [gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/2023-project-1](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/2023-project-1).

Note that the Programming and Project assignment files may not be ready on GitLab until Wednesday or Friday morning, respectively.

Both assignments in Week 1 (Programming Assignment and Project) are self-assessed using the `mude` package in the notebook; you will not need to hand anything in.

**End of file.**
