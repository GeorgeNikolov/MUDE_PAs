    "Since we've already imported the data into our notebook, we could have figured this out without opening the `csv` file. This is easy to do since Numpy returns to us \"numpy arrays\". These arrays are **objects**. Objects are simply wrappers around some data (e.g. array size, data inside array, etc.), and functions (e.g. calculate mean of the array). The data is the object's _attributes_, and the functions are its _methods_. In Python everything is an object, including constructs such as numbers, strings or lists (for more information you could read [this blog](https://realpython.com/python-mutable-vs-immutable-types)). When using code you'll often make custom objects by using classes. Classes like `np.ndarray` (N-dimensional array) are blueprints for objects, but need to be \"instantiated\" to create specific objects called _instances_. That's why there's only one class `np.ndarray`, but you can make arrays of all shapes and sizes which are independent of each other. We will learn more about classes and objects later in the semester; for now you should focus on the fact that as engineers we are constantly working with Python objects, which always have a set of attributes and methods that can make our lives easier.    \n",

We'll need to use methods of `data_y`, but how can we find what they are? Good package documentation always lists this information for the objects that it provides; that of ndarrays can be found [here---take a look!](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) (you don't need to understand everything on this page right now, as long as you recognize that there are a _lot_ of attributes and methods for these objects!). Here is a suggestion for how you can approach this:\n",
    "* If in doubt about the type of your data (i.e., what kind of object it is), try using inspecting it using `type(...)`\n",
    "* As you might have seen on the Documentation page, you can find the mean using the method `.mean()`---pretty logical, right?\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of these suggestions have been typed in the cell below for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to see all the attributes and methods available in an object is to use the `dir` function. This gives a lot of information you don't need to deal with, however, such as internal data or methods. You will also see strange method that start and end with 2 underscores, those are called \"dunder\" methods---an example is `__add__` a special dunder method that gets called when adding two instances together, which allows you to implement custom addition behaviour for your class instances. Don't worry about understanding this now, we will return to it later in the semester. If you don't want to see the output of `dir()` any more, simply comment the command by placing a `# ` at the beginning of the line and rerunning the cell.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "To see why `A` is set up this way, you'll need to read the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html). The online documentation also has a useful search feature, so keep it in mind when working with Numpy! Going back to `lstsq`, the documentation states that it solves the matrix equation:\n",

    "Ax = B\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y = mx + b \n",
    "    \\tag{3}\n",

    "Take a moment to convince yourself that solving this is equivalent to solving for the line!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next we call the actual function, but `lstsq` returns a lot of information, some of which we don't care about and some of which we want to split up. We can use a technique called *tuple unpacking* to separate all the return values into their own variables (we already used this when importing our data from the csv file!). When a Python function returns multiple data, they are packed as a single tuple, e.g. `(return1, return2, return3)`. Unpacking simply means splitting this up again like this: `r1, r2, r3 = (r1, r2, r3)`. We can split further if one of the return values is itself a tuple or a value that can be unpacked (like a Numpy array), by using square brackets or parenthesis: `r1, (nr1, nr2) = (r1, (nr1, nr2))` or `r1, [nr1, nr2] = (r1, (nr1, nr2))`. Finally, if we don't care about a return value, we can use an `_` to ignore it. You still have to include the underscore, even if it's the last time you're throwing away, otherwise Python will think you're trying to unpack the wrong number of values.   \n",
    "3. Here we're using an *f-string* to print a message with the variables embedded in the string. Python offers other ways to format strings with information, but *f-strings* are one of the most flexible and legible.\n",
    "4. We calculate $R^2$ using the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum{(\\hat{y}_i - y_i})^2}{\\sum{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "`lstsq` already returns the top expression, the sum of residuals squared, so we calculate the bottom expression. Numpy arrays define special behaviour for the `-`, `+`, `@`, etc. operators (remember those dunder methods?). In this case, substracting a scalar from the vector will subtract it element-wise. Squaring is also element-wise. Take some time to visualize the transformations on the Numpy array, and how they result in the bottom expression!\n",

    "**Interpretation of $R^2$:** mathematically speaking, this metric is the complement of the mean of the squared errors divided by the variance of the observations. In other words, it is the percentage of variance explained by the model; a high number means that the model (in this case a line) accounts for more of the variation in the data, as opposed to other sources, such as randomness. If this concept is not completely clear to you, don't worry: we will revisit it later in the semester."
