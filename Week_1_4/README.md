# Week 1.4: Let's Check our Model

_[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/), Week 4 of Quarter 1._

This week (4) you have a new repository in GitLab where you can access necessary files. We will continue with topics from last week: more observation theory, and the programming assignment continues with git, requiring you to install some software on your computer.

Files for Wednesday will be added prior to the session.

## Programming Assignment 04 (PA04)

The assignment does not involve a Jupyter notebook. Instead the instructions are provided here:

1. Visit the module website and install the required software (3 parts: git, GitHub Desktop and an SSH key): [mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/git_install/](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/git_install/)
2. Read the page on the module website about [git expectations for MUDE students](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/git/)
3. Read [Chapter P-3.1](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/programming/programs/git/version_control.html) and [Chapter P-3.2](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/programming/programs/git/gui/overview.html) in the online textbook (note: they are programming chapters, hence the "P-" prefix)
4. use the GitHub GUI on your computer to:
    a) clone your personal Week_4_1 repository,
    b) make an edit to REAMDE.md (this file),
    c) make a commit to the local repository,
    d) push the commit to the remote repository.
5. Check that your commit was pushed by viewing the file via the web browser. Then make another commit using the Web IDE.
6. This is the change that I made and pushed via the git CLI. 
7. This is the change that I made and pushed via the Web IDE.

That's it! We will assess PA04 by checking to see if you have edited `README.md` with a commit and push from your computer, as well as a commit with the Web IDE. Do not use the "replace file" option from the web browser!

You are welcome to read [Chapter P-3.3](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/programming/programs/git/cli/overview.html), which covers the use of the CLI, but this is optional.
