    "This is one of two notebooks where, together with your group, you will apply the propagation laws for the mean and variance for a function of two independent random variables. You will assesss how well the approximations correspond with the <em>simulation-based</em> equivalents. You will also assess the distribution of the function.\n",

    "### Application: Sewer Pipe Buckling Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "Local buckling of a sewer pipe due to normal stresses can be modelled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S =20\\times 10^9 \\frac{T}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the stress resulting in buckling, $R$ is the hydraulic radius of the sewer pipe (in $m$), $T$ the wall thickness (in $m$), and the modus of elasticity of concrete equal to $20\\times 10^9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $T$ and $R$ are random variables, as it is known that sewer pipes are susceptible to bending and deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The sewer pipe considered here has mean values $\\mu_T$, $\\mu_R$, and standard deviations $\\sigma_T$ and $\\sigma_R$; $T$ and $R$ are assumed to be statistically independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now interested in the expected stress as well as the uncertainty expressed by the standard deviation. This is important for the design of the sewer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: the dimensions of the pipe come from a real case study, but some aspects of the exercise are...less realistic. We would also like to express our sincere regrets for giving you variables in notebooks A and B with the same symbol, and also acknowledge that the use of \"S\" for stress may be...painfull for some.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add one new package this week to our `mude` environment; refer to the package installation [instructions on the website](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/packages/) and remember to activate your `mude` environment! If you are already using this notebook in Jupyter, simpy start up a new session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that we can increase the default size of the text in our figures to make them more readable!"

The \"Theoretical quantile\" that is plotted on the x-axis of this plot and measures the distance from the median of a distribution, normalized by the standard deviation, such that quantile$=q\\cdot\\sigma)$. For example, $q=-1.5$ is $\\mu-1.5\\cdot\\sigma$. The vertical axis is the value of the random variable.\n",

This is why the Normal PDF will plot as a straight line in `probplot`. Comparing the (vertical) distance between the samples and the theoretical distribution (the red line) allows us to _validate_ our model. In particular, it allows us to validate the model for different regions of the distribution. In your interpretation, for example, you should try and identify whether the model is a good fit for the center and/or tails of the distribution.\n",
