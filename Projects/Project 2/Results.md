## General feedback

This feedback file includes a number of comments that are specific to your report. Our intention is not to comment on every right or wrong aspect, but rather give an indication where major problems or successes were, and indicate where you should pay close attention to the solution. We recommend you make a detailed comparison of your solution with our solution (posted to the modules website [here](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/course-files/Project_2/)). Depending on the grader, you may have shorter or longer comments than other groups, but this does not correlate to your grade.

In general we were quite pleased with your progress and ability to produce well-formatted figures, answer using Markdown cells and provide good insight on the methods. Most groups were able to incorporate all of the code successfully. There were some issues with using Git and GitLab, but we will provide guidance to improve this in Project 3.

If you are using Deepnote: please be sure to check the appearance of your notebook once it has been pushed to GitLab. Refer back to the [website page about Deepnote](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/deepnote/) for further information.

The grading criteria for this project used equal weights for all categories, and should be considered an indication of where you did well and where you may need improvement. If you are considered with the numeric score, remember that we will take into account your progress throughout the semester when considering your final grade.
