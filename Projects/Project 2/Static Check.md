# Static Check

_Note: the results of the static check are not indicative of your grade. This is here to help you fulfill the basic requirements of the assignment._

Make sure you're passing the static check, otherwise you may experience deductions in your grade. Note: you do not have to do anything with the static check for project 2 (don't worry if you have). In the future these may have deadlines for you to adjust your work.

Status: everything good
