# Project 5: Finite Volume Method

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/).*

## Changes to project setup in Q2

Starting in Q2 there are some changes to the Projects, specifically:
- Most projects will be completed on a single Friday (1 week), instead of 2. There is no change in points per week (still 10 points per week; see details [here](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/projects/#grading-criteria-project-portfolio)).
- Weights for each grading category will change: instead of equal weights (0.25 each), the interpretation category will increase. For now, assume that most weeks will use 0.55 for _interpretation_ and 0.15 for the rest.
- You will typically submit your answers in a Markdown file instead of a notebook: `Report.md`. This is the primary document that will be used to determine your grade; however, the auxiliary files (e.g., `*.ipynb` or `*.py` files) may be checked in case something is not clear.
- The deadline is standardized each week: you will always submit your work by making commits to your Group's GitLab repository by Friday at 12:30.
- We will use last commit made before 13:30 so that you can take care of any programming issues; however, this is _not_ to be used to add to your answers in `Report.md`.
- You no longer have to notify MUDE staff if you miss a session, but if your group is not satisfied with your performance (via the Buddy Check) you may be removed from the group.
- Buddy Check will continue to be used every 2 weeks.

## Project 5 Info

The focus of this assignment is on the Finite Volume Method. A notebook is prepared to guide you through the steps, and you will use the results to fill in your answers as instructed in `Report.md`.

This project will be graded with the following weights for each assessment category:

* 0.55 for **Interpretation** 
* 0.15 each for **Documentation**, **Application** and **Programming**.

### Repository, Formatting and Static Check

Static check: there is no static check for this project. Be sure to leave the outputs from your code cells in your `*.ipynb` file so that they are readable.

You are always expected to provide well-formatted figures and Markdown text in your `Report.md` file, as well as logically organize any auxiliary files you may use (e.g., try to put your figures in a sub-directory, if there are a lot of them). If you run out of time it is OK if your `*ipynb` files do not run. The report should summarize all of your findings in a clear and concise way and will be for primary assessment. 

## Group Names

We hope you enjoy your group names. Some of you already figured out that they are collective nouns for animals. What are you?

- knot: eels, frogs, toads
- fall: woodchucks
- trip: goat, hare, seals, sheep, zebra
- bevy: quail, otter, swan, turtle
- rout: coyote, wolf
- host: angel fish, elephant, locust, sparrow
