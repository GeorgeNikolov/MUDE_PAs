# Static Check

_Note: the results of the static check are not indicative of your grade. This is here to help you fulfill the basic requirements of the assignment._

Make sure you're passing the static check, otherwise you may experience deductions in your grade. This week you are expected to have a passing `Taylor.ipynb` and `RungeKutta.ipynb` notebook.

This is the final static check and deadline.

Status: everything good
