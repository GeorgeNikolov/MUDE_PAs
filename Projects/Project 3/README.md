# Project 3: Application of Numerical Methods

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Weeks 5 & 6, Friday Oct 6 & Friday Oct 13, 2023.*

In this assignment you will apply some of the numerical analysis concepts covered in Weeks 5 and 6. Although this may seem simple in comparison to the previous project, these are key building blocks for methods like finite difference, finite volume and finite elements, which we will cover later.

## Objectives

In this assignment you will:
- Apply Taylor series for a function of 1 and 2 variables and evaluate approximation error (Week 5)
- Apply numerical solving schemes and evaluate order of the error (Week 6)

## Report Requirements

This week project report will be submitted via two notebooks, and the template file will be shared with you via your Group repository in `Project 3`. As with other assignments, the report structure is provided to you in the form of **Tasks**, so you only need to fill in code and Markdown cells as directed.

Your notebook should be submitted such that all cell outputs are included, and it can run without errors when the repository is cloned.

Many of you have been using Deepnote for collaborating with your group, but have failed to follow the instructions on the [website](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/deepnote/) to make sure it displays properly in GitLab (hint: open in Jupyter, save, then double-check appearance in GitLab).

## Timeline and Deadlines

**New for Project 3.** We will start to use a _static check_ to evaluate your work on a regular basis. This involves the teaching team making a clone of your repository and checking to see if you have met a few basic requirements. For example, did you use the right file name, and does your notebook run without error? If you did not meet this criteria, you will get a report in the `static_check.md` file notifying you of the issues.

In general static checks for the project repository in a given week will be run every Friday after 13:30, and again on Monday after 8:45. It is your responsibility to make sure that your repository is ready by these deadlines, otherwise you may not receive feedback.

For Project 3, you will receive the following feedback:
- static check on Friday of Week 5
- static check on Monday of Week 6
- static check on Friday of Week 6
- final static check on Monday of Week 7

We will review the notebooks after the final static check, and provide a grade by the end of Wednesday.

## Supplementary Material

Supplementary materials have been provided in a GitLab repository for your group. As of Friday, Week 5, they include:

- this `README.md` with instrucions.
- `Taylor.ipynb`: notebook for Friday, Week 5

Supplementary information for the final Task of `Taylor.ipynb` may be provided via course files, under [Project 3](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/course-files/Project_3/).

## Project Assessment Categories

General information about the project assessment can be found on the course website. In particular for this project, the assessment will focus on:

* **Documentation:** answer the questions in each Task as requested in Markdown cells; use well-formatted figures
* **Application:** complete all Tasks
* **Programming:** notebook runs without errors
* **Interpretation:** answer questions

The weight for each category is 25%.

**New for Project 3:** failure to complete the BuddyCheck will result in -2 points for individual students (each project is worth 20 points).

**End of file.**
