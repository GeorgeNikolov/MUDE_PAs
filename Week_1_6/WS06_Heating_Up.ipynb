    "## Overview\n",
    "This assignment is aimed to developing an understanding the practical applications of the finite difference method. Go through the text that follows and perform all steps outlined therein.\n",

    "The 1-D diffusion equation reads $$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=v\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "where $u$ is a continuous function in space and time, $v$ is a constant and often referred to as the **diffusivity**, giving rise to the name 'diffusion equation'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, the diffusion equation is referred to as the heat equation, in which, $u$ is the temperature and $v$ is the thermal diffusivity. The same equation is also found in other fields of engineering such as, the flow of groundwater through the soil, the intrusion of chemicals in a porous medium etc. Given its omnipresence in engineering, it is imperative to gain an understanding of how one can solve the diffusion equation numerically, regardless of what names we attribute to $u$ and $v$ and the underlying physical phenomenon. This is objective of today's tutorial session. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, let's stick with thermodynamics. The rod in the sketch below, is initially at a uniform temperature of $7°C$. It is then heated asymmetrically (different temperatures) at both ends. The difference in temperatures sets up a thermal gradient, leading to the flow of heat (remember heat cannot flow without a difference in temperature). \n",

    "2. Using the Taylor series to obtain an approximation for the derivatives.\n",

    "## Task 4: Altering the Boundary Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have used Dirichlet boundary conditions, which specify the value of the independent variable at the boundary. Now, suppose the 2-D sheet problem has boundaries that are not sufficiently insulated. What does that imply? It means that the temperature at the boundary may not be held constant and there will be a net heat flux there. Heat flux is given by the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ or $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, such a condition must be prescribed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_w=a(x,y,t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $w$ is the boundary and $w$ is the normal to the boundary. This condition is called a Neumann boundary condition. In case of the 1-D problem (Part 1) on the right boundary, the above becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=L}=a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be modified using the Taylor series expansion as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_{i,j}=u_{i,j-1}+a\\Delta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the value at the boundary $u_{i,j}$ now depends on a point next to the boundary as well, $u_{i,j-1}$ (apart from the $a\\Delta x$). So let's use a vectorised approach to implementing the boundary condition. The terms $a_1$ and $a_2$ in the funciton are now the boundary values at the top and the bottom boundaries of the square sheet (the left and right boundaries still have Dirichlet conditions)"
