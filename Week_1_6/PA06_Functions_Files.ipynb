    "_For this assignment (and all others afterward), you are expected to continue with git and GitHub Desktop to clone your repository, work locally, then push back to origin to submit your assignments._\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is relatively short, and has two parts, focusing on functions, `*.py` files and (more) git tricks!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Importing and using a function from a `*.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this assignment concerns a useful way to apply <a href=\"https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/programming/golden_rules.html#rule-4-write-simple-functions-then-use-them\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Rule 4</a> (re-read it if you forgot!). At this point in the quarter we have sometimes written a number of small short functions, or other long functions to automate tedious tasks, such as formatting figures nicely. This often makes the reading experience in a notebook challenging because we have to scroll through a lot of code to get to the output. We can avoid this issue by instead writing our functions in separate files, then using them in the notebook. In this programming assignment, we will learn the most simple way of doing this, which involves:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. creating a Python file (a file with extension `*.py`)\n",
    "2. writing a function in that file\n",
    "3. importing the function in the notebook\n",
    "4. using the function in the notebook, just like you would any other method in a Python package, for example, Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Ignoring files in your git repo: `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few weeks of using git and GitHub Desktop, you may have noticed that when making commits to GitLab, sometimes some odd files come up in the \"Changes\" tab, for example: `.ipynb_checkpoints`. It turns out these files are not important (you can trust us, but if you would like to know more take a look at <a href=\"https://saturncloud.io/blog/what-are-jupyter-notebook-checkpoint-files-for/#:~:text=Checkpoint%20files%20are%20temporary%20files,directory%20as%20the%20notebook%20file.\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>). Another file we don't care about is a `*.pyc` file, for example in the previous programming assignment: this file is created when we import a module or function (and it will happen again this week!). Since we have no use for these files, it is silly to constantly be adding them to our remote repository on GitLab and keeping track of them. Luckily, git provides a very handy way to ignore them: the `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is** `.gitignore`**?** This is a simple text-based file that lists (on each line) every file that you *do not* want git to track in your local repository. All you have to do is list it, and it will automatically disappear from the \"Changes\" tab in GitHub GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, our notebook will once again create unwanted `.ipynb_checkpoints` and `*.pyc` files. The last task of this assignment will instruct you how to ignore them using a `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "_We will only use this file in a simple way this week, but you can find all sorts of advanced usage tips on the internet if you would like to know more._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will pass this assignment as long as your respository fulfills the following criteria:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- does *not* include a `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder nor any files with the `*.pyc` extension\n",
    "- includes a `.gitignore` file\n",
    "- includes a `function1.py` and `function2.py` file\n",
    "- this notebook exists and runs without errors"
